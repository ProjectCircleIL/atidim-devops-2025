# DevOps Bootcamp Syllabus

This program is designed to give you a thorough understanding of DevOps, which combines software development and IT operations to improve the agility and reliability of software delivery.

The goal of DevOps is to shorten the development lifecycle while also ensuring the quality of updates and releases. You will be introduced to popular DevOps tools and methodologies and gain hands-on experience that you can apply immediately.

Throughout the bootcamp, you'll dive into topics such as software development life cycle management, continuous integration and continuous deployment (CI/CD), Docker, Kubernetes, Git and GitHub, Infrastructure as Code (IaC) with Terraform, Monitoring with Prometheus, and GitOps with ArgoCD.

One of the key aspects of this bootcamp is the practical, hands-on approach. You'll not only learn the theory behind DevOps practices, but also apply that knowledge through a series of hands-on labs and projects.
