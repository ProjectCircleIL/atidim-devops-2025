# Exercise 2: SDLC Model Comparison

**Duration:** 45 minutes  
**Difficulty:** Beginner  
**Type:** Analysis + Planning

## Objective
Compare different SDLC models and choose the most appropriate one for your final project application.

## Background
You're tasked with developing a 3-tier web application (Frontend + Backend + Database) that will be deployed using modern DevOps practices. You need to choose an SDLC model that best supports continuous delivery and DevOps principles.

## Application Requirements
- **Frontend:** Web-based user interface
- **Backend:** REST API with business logic
- **Database:** Persistent data storage
- **Deployment:** Cloud-based Kubernetes cluster
- **Timeline:** 8 weeks development + deployment
- **Team Size:** 2-4 developers
- **Expected Changes:** Frequent feature requests from stakeholders

## Tasks

### Task 1: SDLC Model Analysis (20 minutes)

Create a comparison matrix for the following models:

| Criteria | Waterfall | Agile (Scrum) | DevOps/CI-CD | Lean |
|----------|-----------|---------------|--------------|------|
| **Flexibility to Change** | | | | |
| **Time to Market** | | | | |
| **Quality Assurance** | | | | |
| **Team Collaboration** | | | | |
| **Risk Management** | | | | |
| **Suitable for DevOps** | | | | |

Rate each (1-5 scale): 1 = Poor, 5 = Excellent

### Task 2: Technology Stack Planning (15 minutes)

Based on your SDLC choice, plan your technology stack:

**Frontend Options:**
- React.js + Node.js
- Vue.js + Node.js  
- Angular + Node.js
- Python Flask/Django with templates
- Other: ________________

**Backend Options:**
- Node.js + Express
- Python (Flask/FastAPI/Django)
- Java (Spring Boot)
- Go
- Other: ________________

**Database Options:**
- PostgreSQL
- MySQL
- MongoDB
- Redis (for caching)
- Other: ________________

**Your Choice & Justification:**
- Frontend: ________________
  Reason: ________________
- Backend: ________________
  Reason: ________________
- Database: ________________
  Reason: ________________

### Task 3: Development Phases Planning (10 minutes)

Break down your project into phases/sprints:

| Phase | Duration | Deliverables | Dependencies |
|-------|----------|--------------|--------------|
| Phase 1 | Week 1-2 | | |
| Phase 2 | Week 3-4 | | |
| Phase 3 | Week 5-6 | | |
| Phase 4 | Week 7-8 | | |

## Deliverables
- Completed SDLC comparison matrix
- Technology stack selection with justification
- Project phase breakdown
- Written explanation (200 words) of why your chosen SDLC model is best for this project

## Success Criteria
- Demonstrated understanding of different SDLC models
- Made informed technology choices based on DevOps principles
- Created realistic project timeline
- Justified decisions with clear reasoning

## Integration with Future Modules
Your technology stack choices will be used in:
- **Module 2:** Setting up Git repositories and GitHub Actions workflows
- **Module 3:** Creating Dockerfiles for your chosen technologies  
- **Module 4:** Deploying to Kubernetes
- **Modules 5-8:** Building CI/CD pipelines, monitoring, and infrastructure

## Bonus Challenge
Research and document:
1. What CI/CD tools work best with your chosen technology stack?
2. What testing frameworks are available for your technologies?
3. What are the containerization best practices for your stack?
