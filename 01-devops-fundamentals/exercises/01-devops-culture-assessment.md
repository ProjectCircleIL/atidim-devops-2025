# Exercise 1: DevOps Culture Assessment

**Duration:** 30 minutes  
**Difficulty:** Beginner  
**Type:** Theory + Discussion

## Objective
Assess your current understanding of DevOps culture and identify areas for improvement in traditional development workflows.

## Scenario
You are joining a company that is transitioning from a traditional waterfall development model to a DevOps approach. The company currently has:
- Development teams that work in isolation
- Monthly releases that often fail
- Manual testing and deployment processes
- Blame culture when things go wrong
- Limited communication between Dev and Ops teams

## Tasks

### Task 1: Current State Analysis (10 minutes)
Create a simple table identifying problems with the current approach:

| Problem Area | Current State | Impact on Business |
|--------------|---------------|-------------------|
| Release Frequency | Monthly | Slow time to market |
| Communication | | |
| Testing | | |
| Deployment | | |
| Culture | | |

### Task 2: DevOps Transformation Plan (15 minutes)
For each problem area identified, propose a DevOps solution:

| Problem Area | DevOps Solution | Expected Outcome |
|--------------|-----------------|------------------|
| Release Frequency | Implement CI/CD pipelines | Daily/Weekly releases |
| Communication | | |
| Testing | | |
| Deployment | | |
| Culture | | |

### Task 3: Reflection Questions (5 minutes)
Answer the following questions:

1. What is the most significant cultural change needed for DevOps adoption?
2. How would you measure the success of a DevOps transformation?
3. What resistance might you expect from different teams?

## Deliverables
- Completed analysis tables
- Written reflection answers
- Be prepared to discuss your findings with the group

## Success Criteria
- Identified at least 5 problem areas
- Provided realistic DevOps solutions
- Demonstrated understanding of cultural aspects of DevOps

## Next Steps
This assessment will help you understand the challenges you'll solve using the tools and practices covered in upcoming modules (Git, Docker, Kubernetes, CI/CD tools).
