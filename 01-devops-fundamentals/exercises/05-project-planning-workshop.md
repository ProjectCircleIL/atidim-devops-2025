# Exercise 5: Project Planning Workshop

**Duration:** 120 minutes  
**Difficulty:** Advanced  
**Type:** Strategic Planning + Documentation

## Objective
Create a comprehensive project plan for your final project that incorporates all DevOps practices and tools you'll learn throughout the course. This will serve as your roadmap and success criteria.

## Background

## Final Project Reminder
Your final project will include:
- **Application:** Frontend + Backend + Database (your chosen stack)
- **Infrastructure:** AWS/Cloud deployment with Terraform
- **CI/CD:** Automated pipelines with Jenkins/GitHub Actions
- **Containerization:** Docker containers and Kubernetes deployment
- **GitOps:** ArgoCD-managed deployments
- **Monitoring:** Prometheus/Grafana dashboards
- **Collaboration:** Git workflows, code reviews, documentation

## Tasks

### Task 2: Infrastructure and DevOps Architecture (45 minutes)

**2.1 Infrastructure Architecture (20 minutes)**

Design your cloud infrastructure:

```markdown
## Infrastructure Architecture

**Cloud Provider:** AWS/Azure/GCP
**Kubernetes Cluster:** EKS/AKS/GKE
**Networking:** VPC, subnets, security groups
**Storage:** EBS volumes, S3 buckets
**Databases:** RDS, ElastiCache (if needed)
**Load Balancing:** ALB/NLB
**DNS:** Route53/CloudFlare
**Monitoring:** CloudWatch + Prometheus
**Logging:** CloudWatch Logs + ELK Stack
```

**2.2 DevOps Tools Architecture (25 minutes)**

Map out your DevOps toolchain:

| Category | Tool Choice | Integration Points |
|----------|-------------|-------------------|
| Source Control | Git + GitHub | All repositories |
| CI/CD Platform | Jenkins OR GitHub Actions | |
| Container Registry | ECR/DockerHub | |
| Container Orchestration | Kubernetes (EKS) | |
| GitOps | ArgoCD | |
| Infrastructure as Code | Terraform | |
| Configuration Management | Helm Charts | |
| Monitoring | Prometheus + Grafana | |
| Logging | ELK Stack OR CloudWatch | |
| Alerting | Slack integration | |
| Security Scanning | | |

### Task 3: Implementation Timeline (30 minutes)

Create a detailed week-by-week implementation plan:

| Week | Module Focus | Your Implementation Tasks | Deliverables |
|------|--------------|---------------------------|--------------|
| 1 | DevOps Fundamentals | Complete application design, set up project structure | Architecture docs, basic project setup |
| 2 | Git/GitHub | Set up repositories, implement Git workflow, basic CI | Git repos, initial GitHub Actions |
| 3 | Docker | Containerize applications, create Docker Compose | Dockerfiles, local container deployment |
| 4-5 | Kubernetes | Deploy to K8s, create Helm charts | K8s manifests, Helm charts, cluster deployment |
| 6 | Jenkins | Implement CI/CD pipelines | Jenkins pipelines, automated builds |
| 7 | GitOps/ArgoCD | Set up GitOps deployment | ArgoCD setup, GitOps workflows |
| 8 | Terraform | Infrastructure as Code | Terraform modules, AWS infrastructure |
| 9 | Monitoring | Implement observability | Prometheus/Grafana dashboards, alerts |

**For each week, define:**
- Specific technical tasks
- Success criteria  
- Dependencies on previous weeks
- Risk mitigation strategies

### Task 4: Risk Assessment and Mitigation (15 minutes)

Identify potential risks and mitigation strategies:

| Risk Category | Specific Risks | Impact (H/M/L) | Mitigation Strategy |
|---------------|----------------|----------------|-------------------|
| **Technical** | Technology learning curve | H | Start with simpler alternatives, allocate extra time |
| | Tool integration issues | M | |
| **Infrastructure** | Cloud cost overruns | M | Set up billing alerts, use free tier |
| | Service outages | L | |
| **Timeline** | Scope creep | H | Fixed scope, clear requirements |
| | Dependencies delays | M | |
| **Skills** | Missing expertise | H | Online resources, peer support, instructor help |
